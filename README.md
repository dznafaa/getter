# [Getter](https://github.com/gowondesigns/getter/)

Getter is a single file, PHP powered download handler and logging script.

## Installation and Configuration

All editable options are contained in the Configuration class:

 - `BASE_DIRECTORY`
 - `HOTLINK_PROTECTION`
 - `HOTLINK_REDIRECT_URL`
 - `COMPRESS_DOWNLOADS`
 - `LOG_DOWNLOADS` - Flag to log downloads. Default is __true__.
 - `LOG_FILENAME` 
 - `PANEL_ON` - Web Panel is on and accessible. Default is __true__.
 - `PANEL_URI` - The URI token used to reach the Web Panel. Default is __admin__.
 - `PANEL_ITEMS_MAX_NUM` - Maximum number of log entries listed on the Web Panel
 - `PANEL_USERNAME` - HTTP Auth username
 - `PANEL_PASSWORD` - HTTP Auth password
 - `PANEL_CSS` - Internal CSS Stylesheet for the Web Panel

## Serving Downloads
There are 3 ways to download a file using Getter:

```html
download.php?[FILENAME]
download.php?[FILENAME]/[ALIAS]
download.php?[FILENAME HASH]/[ALIAS]
```

Given a filename, Getter will perform a [depth-first search](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search) through the directory set in `BASE_DIRECTORY`.

## Managing the Download Log
When `LOG_DOWNLOADS` is enabled, Getter will log every download that it handles on the server into a single CSV. This file is generated in the same directory that Getter resides in. It will collect a date-timestamp, the client's IP Address, the Request URL, and the file that was requested.

### Acessing the Web Panel
When `PANEL_ON` is set to __true__, you can manage the log using Getter's built-in web panel. Use the `PANEL_ON` token as part of the URL to access this. The default token is __admin__, and the default URL is:

```html
http://www.yourdomain.com/download.php?admin
```

NOTE: Clearing the log deletes the logged data off the server, not just the page. You cannot recover your log data after you've cleared it.

### Using CSV
The logs generated by Getter are plain text ASCII CSV files. These logs can be viewed raw by any ASCII editor or Word Processor like Notepad, Wordpad, and Microsoft Word. The file should can easily be imported into spreadsheet applications like Excel.
